                From the age of 6, I really loved play video games. It was 2005 and my brother got married and was moving out and he came to me and gifted me with a Sega Mega Drive, Playstation 1 and 2 (I was very lucky). I played on them all the time with my friends and cousins. Then, when I was 7, I went to a car boot sale with my grandmother and mom and I came across a Xbox and a Nintendo Game Cube I asked for my them to buy it for me and they did, I was suprised usually they would say you have enough already.

                It was October 17th 2008, I was turning 10. On TV, everytime I would see PSPs and Nintendo DS on adverts all the time. I really wanted them and I would leave my mom and brother hints. Luckily, my mom bought me a Nintendo DS. I was happy but i'll be honest I would of rather got the PSP. My brother said my present would come the next day I thought he just forgot but the next day he came to pick up me up and take me out. It was a fun day out and the end of the day, he gave me a PSP and I was happy and couldn't believe it. Not only this, he showed me a Game Boy Advance. He said he found it long time ago and gave it to me I was shocked as I was very old and never seen it before.

                When I was 13, I saved money from 11 and bought a PlayStation 3 it took a long time but was worth it. As I was not able to play with my friends online. Couple months later, we had a friend who had a Xbox 360 but everyone had Playstation 3 so he had no one to play with until eventually he bought a PlayStation 3. Now, I really had a habit of trying new or old game consoles so I asked to borrow his Xbox 360 and I did. I had it for so long and played it all the time and one day he didn't want it and told me to keep it, I was grateful to have a friend like that. As time went on, I got older and newer game consoles started to get released so I started to think of ways to earn money. I did a lot of jobs by the age of 16, I had enough to buy anything I wanted with asking my mom or brother. I bought a Playstation 4 and PSP 3000.

                At 16, I could finally get a proper job which I did. This is where I could earn more and collect more game consoles. I bought a Xbox One, Nintendo Wii (I still play with my little nephews and mom), PS4 Pro, PS Vita and Nintendo Switch. Right now, I am 20 and I have over 17 game consoles. Just waiting for the PS5.
